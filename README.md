## Why bother you might say?
Briefly after our group of old farts migrated from TeamSpeak to Discord, a couple of us discovered the use of bots. We were excited about the possible usage of a bot for our server, and wanted to make one for our selves. After delving info the basics we began to develop a competetive mindset, and started aiming to make it better than the other alternatives out there.
